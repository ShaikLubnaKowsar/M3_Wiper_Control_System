The Wiper is a component that has a rubber blade whose cross section has a rectangular middle part with T-Shaped Projection on one side & a wedge shaped element connected
to the rectangular part by a narrow neck on other side.The wiper moves over the windscreen the glass surface is first cleaned by the bristles on the forward side of the
wiper blade.The System required manual wiper activation,by changing the frequency as its results the operation of bringing up the wiper speed is varied. The project's 
goals are to improve ageing cars' systems by giving automated transmission.wiping system, to improve the system by incorporating a sensor and actuator, and to create a 
simple software that would completely operate with the system.This system will be upgraded to an automatic control system using a Peripheral Interface to remove water 
from the windscreen.
