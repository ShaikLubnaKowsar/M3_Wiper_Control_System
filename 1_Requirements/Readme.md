## INTRODUCTION

The operational speed of a wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control system in accordance with frequencies. The pulse signal is digitally processed to provide a control signal. A wiper driver circuit receives the control signal and adjusts the operational speed or timing in line with it.

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

STM32 CUBE IDE

## COMPONENTS

STM32F4O7VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD

## DESCRIPTION

The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family is based on the high-performance Arm速 Cortex速-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 168 MHz. The Cortex-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family incorporates high-speed embedded memories (Flash memory up to 1 Mbyte, up to 192 Kbytes of SRAM), up to 4 Kbytes of backup SRAM, and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, three AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.All devices offer three 12-bit ADCs, two DACs, a low-power RTC, twelve general-purpose 16-bit timers including two PWM timers for motor control, two general-purpose 32-bit timers. a true random number generator (RNG). They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces.

## FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER

. Core: Arm速 32-bit Cortex速-M4 CPU with FPU, Adaptive real-time accelerator.
. LCD parallel interface, 8080/6800 modes.
. Clock, reset and supply management.
. USB ST-LINK with three separate interfaces and re-enumeration capability.
. Board power is supplied through USB or an external 5 V supply source.

## USES

The STM32F407/417 lines are designed for medical, industrial and consumer applications where the high level of integration and performance, embedded memories and rich peripheral set inside packages as small as 10 x 10 mm are required.

## WORKING PRINCIPLE

Assume that the automobile is the microcontroller. If the button is hit, the first led (red) will turn on, Clicking again  the wiper will start, and the second led (blue) will turn on for a desired rate. If the button is pressed again, the third led (green) will turn on, and the wiper's speed will be increased in comparison to the previous one. The fourth press will turn on the fourth led (orange), and the wiper speed will be increased in accordance with the previous one. The microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off after the fifth click.
